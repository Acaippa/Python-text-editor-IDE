# Python-text-editor-IDE
A text editor made in python using tkinter. 
Originally i made this program because the built-in IDE's on the raspberry pi was super laggy, and i thought it was because of the program itself being heavy for the cpu. So as a logical jump forward, i decided to make my own simple IDE. 
This however will not be a super lightweight IDE.
